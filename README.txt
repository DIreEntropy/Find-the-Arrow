Most of the functionality in the findthearrow.py is working. The next steps to be implemented are getting the board with the legend to properly print/write to a file or the CL. Along with creating moves for the player to actually use to play the game. 

I have been stuck on the layout/legend writing part and have decided to post it on github in hopes of gaining some feedback. Feel free to tinker with the code. 

I have been fudging things up in the Board.py for a few nights, so odds are there might be some errors if you try to run the code as-is.
