
Here are the game rules, good luck and have some fun!!! =)

Find the ##-->>(Arrow) - Will be this big in the game area as well.

The play area is 10x40 and all of the 'hash marks' or 'pound signs', whichever
you prefer, are considered concealed from view. During each of the players turns
they are able to make one of three possible moves:

1. Reveal what is behind a single hash/pound.
2. Reveal what is behind a 4x4 area of the play field.
3. Or divide the play area into two equal halves. If multiple play areas are already
present, the two halves will rejoin and the arrows location will be randomized again.

If option one is chosen during a turn, that hash mark will be 'revealed' and
remain in this state unless on a consecutive turn option two or three has been
chosen.

If option two is chosen, the 4x4 area selected will be revealed to the player.
As well as possibly triggering one or more events to occur:
A. All other hash marks already revealed to the player are again concealed.
B. The play area could be split/rejoined, depending on current state. Randomizing
the arrows location afterwards.(4x4 will remain revealed)
C. The arrow will be split into two or three pieces.

If option three is chosen, when a hash mark is revealed after the screen is
split into two play areas, each new reveal will be mirrored to the opposite
play area when option one is used. If a mirrored hash has already been revealed
then it will return to a concealed state.
